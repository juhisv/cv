      <p><strong>1930-1940</strong></p>
      <p>I was created by Walt Disney when he heard Clarence Nash doing a peculiar voice while reciting "Mary Had a Little Lamb". Nash described the voice as a goat; Walt, however, insisted that it was a duck. Nash was hired on the spot, and with a voice in place, a stage was needed to put my new duck character to the test. The solution came in the form of Walt's experimental Silly Symphony cartoon series. I made my first appearance in The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934. In the cartoon, me and my friend, Peter Pig, lie their way out of helping the titular little hen tend to her corn. My appearance in the cartoon, as created by animators Art Babbitt and Dick Huemer, is similar to my modern look; the feather, and beak colors are the same, as is the blue sailor shirt and hat, but my features are more elongated, my body plumper, and my feet bigger. My iconic voice, done by its originator Clarence Nash, is also the same. Notably, the manner of speech in which the characters' voices are based on their respective animals is used for every character, rather than being a trait belonging solely to me. My personality is not developed either; in the short, he merely fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story.</p>
      <p><strong>1940-1950</strong></p>
      <p>After the 1937 success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs" class="linkki">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></i>, Walt Disney began development and planning for several animated feature films to follow suit. However, with World War II hitting, Walt Disney Studios was forced to go on a standstill, only having the ability to produce package films. There was a particular interest in the South America market, primarily due to the inability to import cartoons into Occupied Europe as a result of the war. I, with his stardom rising, would appear in four of the package films-three set in South America. The first of which was my first appearance in a feature-length film, 1943's Saludos Amigos, which introduced I to a Brazilian parrot named Jose Carioca. In 1944, I and Jose were paired with a bombastic rooster named Panchito Pistoles to form the titular trio in The Three Caballeros. my part in the Caballeros would go on to become one of his most recognizable and beloved roles. my other two appearances in the package film era included Fun and Fancy Free in 1947 (opposite Mickey and Goofy in the Mickey and the Beanstalk segment), and Melody Time in 1948 (alongside Jose Carioca and the Aracuan Bird).</p>
      <p><strong>1950-1990</strong></p>
      <p>At this time, I had become one of the most recognizable icons in the world, as well as one of the most popular, surpassing Mickey Mouse as the company's biggest animated star. Walt even referred to me as the "Gable of our stable", in reference to the renowned Hollywood actor, Clark Gable. With such a title, I would begin appearing in every form of media and merchandise as Disney's poster-boy and primary audience draw. Much like Mickey and Goofy, My role became a tad tamer and most of his cartoons centered on struggling with everyday life, parenting his nephews, and battling Chip and Dale. The 1950s also marked Walt Disney's entry into television, in which I would become a staple, making regular appearances in the Disneyland television series. While many theatrical short subject series ended production during the 1953-1954 season, I continued to appear in theatrical cartoons after that season.</p>
	  <p><strong>1990-present</strong></p>
	  <p>In the 1990 short, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Pauper_(1990_film)" class="linkki">The Prince and the Pauper</a>, I appeared as the valet of the prince (played by Mickey Mouse). Tony Anselmo notably had a hand in animating I in the featurette. In 1996, I was given his own sitcom series as part of the Disney Afternoon block with Quack Pack, in which he is the suburban guardian of a teenage Huey, Dewey and Louie. The show was poorly received, however, and only lasted for one season.</p>
	  <p>In 1999, I made his final theatrical appearance in the Noah's Ark segment of Fantasia 2000 - a role inspired by Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprentice. The same year marked the debut of Mickey Mouse Works, which gave I a new series of made-for-television shorts. In 2002, I and Goofy co-starred in Kingdom Hearts, an action role-playing game. During development, Disney campaigned to have I serve as the protagonist, while Squaresoft wanted to use Mickey. The opposing views were rectified with the creation of Sora. I would nevertheless appear as a major character in the game, and a majority of its follow-up titles. In 2003, I was given his own theme park attraction in Walt Disney World, though ironically named after Mickey: Mickey's Philharmagic. Most of my dialogue is actually compiled from archival recordings by Clarence Nash. Tony Anselmo recorded only five new lines for the character in this attraction (such as when I hums to the tune of the song "Be Our Guest").</p>
	  <p>In 2005, I received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, joining other characters such as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Kermit the Frog, and Snow White. The star is located at 6840 Hollywood Blvd.In 2012, I appeared in the animated short starring Minnie Mouse, Electric Holiday, as a brief cameo.In 2017, a DuckTales reboot premiered on television. Though the show mainly centers on Scrooge McDuck and the nephews, I was given a much larger role as a main character. He is portrayed as an overprotective single parent to the triplets and former sidekick to Scrooge. The series is also significant for marking the first time I has shared the screen with a number of his comic co-stars; examples include Della Duck and Gladstone Gander.</p>

    <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
	<p>My two dominant personality traits are my fiery-temper and upbeat attitude to life. Many of my shorts start with a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils my day. My rage is a great cause of suffering in my life. On multiple occasions, it has caused for me to get in over to my head and lose competitions. There are times when I fight to keep my temper in check, and sometimes I succeed in doing so temporarily, but usually I always return to my normal angry self in the end.
